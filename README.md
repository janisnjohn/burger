#Eat-Da-burger
** This app is a burger logger that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebards and ORM.  I used MVC design pattern and used Node and MySQL to query and route data and then used Handlebards to generate the HTML.**

-Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat.
- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the burger will display on the left side -waiting to be devoured.
- The app will store each burger in the waiting area until you DEVOUR IT! and click the button.
- When you click the button the burger will then go to the right side in the devoured section.
